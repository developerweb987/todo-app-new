# Todo App Evolution Constitution
<!-- Evolution of Todo – 5-Phase Spec-Driven Development Hackathon -->

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development
All features must be implemented strictly via Spec-Driven methodology; no manual coding allowed. Every implementation must be traceable to a specification document.

### II. Incremental Evolution
Features must progress from Basic → Intermediate → Advanced levels across the 5 phases. Each phase must build upon the previous phase with clear progression milestones.

### III. AI Integration
Conversational AI must manage the Todo list intelligently in Phases III-V. The AI chatbot must maintain state and manage tasks via conversational interface.

### IV. Cloud-Native Deployment
All deployments must follow best practices for Kubernetes and cloud orchestration. All deployments must pass local and cloud validation checks.

### V. Reproducibility
All Specs, Markdown Constitutions, and Claude Code outputs must be fully traceable and reproducible. Full traceability of all Specs, Markdown Constitutions, and implementation outputs.

### VI. Quality Assurance
All phases must pass internal QA for feature correctness. AI chatbot correctly interprets and executes natural language commands.

## Technology Stack Requirements
<!-- Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

Phase I: Python, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus
Phase II: Next.js, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon DB
Phase III: OpenAI ChatKit, Agents SDK, Official MCP SDK
Phase IV: Docker, Minikube, Helm, kubectl-ai, kagent
Phase V: Kafka, Dapr, DigitalOcean DOKS

All Specs and Markdown documents must be in English.
Deployment must pass local and cloud validation checks and meet performance standards.

## Development Workflow
<!-- Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

Claude Code generates fully functional Todo implementations from Specs.
Local and cloud deployments run without errors and meet performance standards.
Completion of all 5 phases within hackathon deadlines.

## Governance
<!-- Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

All implementations must follow the specified technology stacks for each phase.
All Specs and Markdown documents must be in English.
All development must follow the 5-phase progression model.
